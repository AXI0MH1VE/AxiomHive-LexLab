This is not a product announcement. It is an imperative.

"Apex Strategy: The Ascension of Alexis Adams" defines a new substrate for intelligence. We are recruiting engineers, founders, and system architects who can execute at the kernel level. Join us to build Runtime Zero and AxiomHive — deterministic modules that run airgap-first, produce provable outputs, and lock narrative control.

Three directives require immediate adoption:

1) Determinism Over Probability — eliminate nondeterministic behavior from critical decision paths.
2) Sovereignty Over Convenience — design identity and keys to be locally held and cryptographically portable.
3) Narrative Controls Reality — control the framing before others set the frame.

This is urgent. Act as an operator, not a user. If you intend to execute, respond with capabilities, not intent.
