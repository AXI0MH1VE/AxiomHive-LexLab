# AxiomHive-LexLab
Status: Technical Preview â€¢ License: MIT
AxiomHive-LexLab is a precision-grade, modular lab for lawful, reproducible, and verifiable text analytics. It combines auditable pipelines, cryptographic integrity, privacy-first local/air-gapped deployment, and API-extensible modules with deterministic builds and compliance posture reporting.
1) Vision and Strategic Positioning
- Mission: Provide a verifiable, regulator-ready NLP and text forensics stack that prioritizes traceability, security, and reproducibility without sacrificing speed or developer ergonomics.
- Strategy: Treat every pipeline as evidence. Every transformation is logged, hashed, and reproducible across machines, enabling defense, research, and regulated industries to trust outputs.
- Differentiation: Built-in audit trails, content-addressed artifacts, crypto-backed provenance, deterministic environments, deep inspection modes, and quantum-conscious cryptography options. Designed to operate fully offline.
- Target Users: Security researchers, compliance officers, regulated biotech/finance, defense analysis teams, enterprise data science, and academic labs.
2) Advanced Features
- Modular Audit Trails: Each pipeline stage emits a structured record: inputs, parameters, code references, environment fingerprint, duration, outputs. Records are chained via content hashes.
- Cryptographic Integrity: SHA-256 by default; optional BLAKE3 and SHA3-256. Merkle DAG for artifact stores. Signed manifests (Sigstore/Cosign-compatible) and optional hardware-backed keys (YubiKey/PKCS#11).
- Local/Air-Gap Deploy: Zero external calls by default. Vendored models/dicts. Fully reproducible setup via lockfiles and hermetic runners. Optional container or Nix.
- Quantum-Secure Pipelines (experimental): Pluggable PQC signature scheme adapters (e.g., Dilithium via external libs) for manifests and attestations. Disabled by default; gated via config.
- Deep Inspection Modes: Deterministic tokenization, Unicode normalization maps, boundary decisions, and regex engine traces. Exportable step-by-step diffs and heatmaps.
- API Extensibility: Stable plugin interface for sources, transforms, analysers, and exporters. Versioned contracts with semantic capability descriptors.
- Reproducibility: Content-addressed datasets and artifacts, pinned dependencies, exact seed control, frozen locales, and canonical I/O encodings.
