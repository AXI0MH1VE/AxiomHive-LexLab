# AxiomHive-LexLab

Status: Technical Preview â€¢ License: MIT

AxiomHive-LexLab is a precision-grade, modular lab for lawful, reproducible, and verifiable text analytics. It combines auditable pipelines, cryptographic integrity, privacy-first local/air-gapped deployment, and API-extensible modules with deterministic builds and compliance posture reporting.


1) Vision and Strategic Positioning
- Mission: Provide a verifiable, regulator-ready NLP and text forensics stack that prioritizes traceability, security, and reproducibility without sacrificing speed or developer ergonomics.
- Strategy: Treat every pipeline as evidence. Every transformation is logged, hashed, and reproducible across machines, enabling defense, research, and regulated industries to trust outputs.
- Differentiation: Built-in audit trails, content-addressed artifacts, crypto-backed provenance, deterministic environments, deep inspection modes, and quantum-conscious cryptography options. Designed to operate fully offline.
- Target Users: Security researchers, compliance officers, regulated biotech/finance, defense analysis teams, enterprise data science, and academic labs.


2) Advanced Features
- Modular Audit Trails: Each pipeline stage emits a structured record: inputs, parameters, code references, environment fingerprint, duration, outputs. Records are chained via content hashes.
- Cryptographic Integrity: SHA-256 by default; optional BLAKE3 and SHA3-256. Merkle DAG for artifact stores. Signed manifests (Sigstore/Cosign-compatible) and optional hardware-backed keys (YubiKey/PKCS#11).
- Local/Air-Gap Deploy: Zero external calls by default. Vendored models/dicts. Fully reproducible setup via lockfiles and hermetic runners. Optional container or Nix.
- Quantum-Secure Pipelines (experimental): Pluggable PQC signature scheme adapters (e.g., Dilithium via external libs) for manifests and attestations. Disabled by default; gated via config.
- Deep Inspection Modes: Deterministic tokenization, Unicode normalization maps, boundary decisions, and regex engine traces. Exportable step-by-step diffs and heatmaps.
- API Extensibility: Stable plugin interface for sources, transforms, analysers, and exporters. Versioned contracts with semantic capability descriptors.
- Reproducibility: Content-addressed datasets and artifacts, pinned dependencies, exact seed control, frozen locales, and canonical I/O encodings.
- Compliance Toolkit: Automated SBOM, license scan, third-party notices, policy checks, and pipeline attestations (SLSA-aligned). Red/Amber/Green compliance summary.

Data Model and Flow:
- Stage: A named, versioned unit of work with declared inputs/outputs and side-effect policy.
- Run: A concrete execution of a pipeline with parameter hash, environment fingerprint, and seed.
- Artifact: Immutable blob stored by content hash, referenced by manifest.
- Manifest: Signed record of stages, artifacts, provenance, and compliance status.


4) Installation and Configuration
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.11+ (3.12 recommended)
- OS: Linux x86_64/arm64, macOS 13+, Windows 11 (WSL supported)
- Optional: Docker 24+, Podman, or Nix 2.20+

Quickstart (pip):
- git clone https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE/AxiomHive-LexLab.git
- cd AxiomHive-LexLab
- python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
- pip install -U pip wheel
- pip install -e .[all]

Reproducible environment (UV or Rye optional):
- Use requirements.lock/uv.lock for hermetic resolves: pip install -r requirements.lock

Containerized:
- docker build -t axiomlex:dev -f ops/containers/Dockerfile .
- docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/work" axiomlex:dev

Configuration:
- Create lexlab.yaml in project root or pass --config path
- Example:
  pipeline:
    name: baseline_nlp
    seed: 42
  storage:
    cas_dir: ./.lexlab/cas
  crypto:
    hash: sha256
    sign: false
  compliance:
    sbom: true
    slsa_level: 2
  inspection:
    regex_trace: false


5) Real-World Use Cases
- Regulatory Filings QA: Validate tokenization and normalization on financial disclosures; produce SARIF issues for downstream triage.
- Defense Intel Text Pipelines: Air-gapped entity extraction with deterministic outputs and signed manifests.
- Biomedical Literature Reviews: Reproducible corpora, audit trails for inclusion/exclusion, and exportable evidence bundles.
- E-Discovery and Chain-of-Custody: Immutable artifacts, time-bound regex scans with trace, and signed handoff manifests.
- Academic Benchmarks: Frozen seeds/locales for fair comparisons; public artifact store with hashes.


6) Step-by-Step Usage
- Initialize project store:
  lexlab init --cas ./.lexlab/cas
- Run a pipeline from a config file:
  lexlab run --config lexlab.yaml --input data/input/*.txt --export reports/report.json
- Enable deep inspection traces:
  lexlab run --config lexlab.yaml --inspect all --export reports/trace.html
- Verify integrity of an existing run:
  lexlab verify --manifest runs/2025-10-11T00-00Z/manifest.json
- Generate SBOM and attestation:
  lexlab attest --output attest/spdx.json --sign=false

Artifacts Produced per Run:
- runs/<ts>/audit.jsonl: stage-by-stage records
- runs/<ts>/manifest.json: signed/unsigned manifest linking artifacts
- .lexlab/cas/: content-addressed storage of blobs
- reports/: human-readable outputs (JSON/HTML/SARIF)
