# AxiomHive: Operator-Grade Proof-Driven Cognitive Infrastructure

**THIS IS NOT A TOY, DEMO, OR SURVEILLANCE AI.**

AxiomHive is production-ready, deterministic, operator-controlled infrastructure for engineers and organizations that demand zero black-boxes, full auditability, and cryptographic proof of integrity. No personality wrapper. No cloud dependency. No hidden telemetry. This is professional cognitive computing architecture designed for sovereignty, reproducibility, and high-stakes deployment.

**Included: Full-Stack Chatbot Interface + Operator-Grade Cognitive Modules**

This system provides an integrated web-based chatbot interface backed by transparent, auditable cognitive modules. You get immediate, local, interactive access to proof-driven reasoning with complete operator control—not a black-box API call, but a sovereign cognitive engine you run, validate, and audit on your own infrastructure.

## How the Chatbot Interface Works: Launch, Interact, Control

**Launching the Interface:**

1. **Start the Backend:** Run `./run.sh` in the `backend/` directory (or use `run_local.ps1` on Windows PowerShell from the repo root).
2. **Access the UI:** Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui/` — the integrated chatbot interface loads immediately.
3. **No Cloud Required:** Everything runs locally on your machine. No external API calls, no telemetry, no vendor dependency.

**What You See:**

The chatbot interface is a React-based frontend that communicates with the FastAPI backend. You interact through a conversational interface, but behind every response is a transparent cognitive pipeline:

- **Reasoning Path Visibility:** See step-by-step logical decomposition of queries.
- **Advanced Cognitive Metrics:** Access real-time data on emotional analysis, safety checks, ethical evaluations, and pattern detection.
- **Verification Breakdowns:** Review cryptographic integrity checks, module attestations, and validation results inline.
- **Operator Options:** Toggle advanced modes, adjust reasoning depth, enable/disable specific cognitive modules (Ethics Sentinel, Safety Guardian, etc.), and inspect memory traces.

**Operator Interaction Workflow:**

1. **Send a Query:** Type a question, request, or task into the chatbot.
2. **Review Cognitive Processing:** Watch as the system routes your query through modular cognitive layers—emotional analysis, ethical screening, safety monitoring, logical reasoning, pattern detection.
3. **Inspect Reasoning:** Expand reasoning-path panels to see how conclusions were reached. Every step is auditable.
4. **Control Modules:** Use operator controls to enable/disable modules, adjust validation thresholds, or force specific reasoning strategies.
5. **Validate Integrity:** Run on-demand integrity checks via the UI or backend API to confirm cryptographic attestation of system state.
6. **Export Traces:** Download audit logs, reasoning graphs, and memory traces for compliance review or third-party verification.

**Unique Operator Options:**

- **Reasoning Depth Control:** Set shallow (fast) or deep (exhaustive) reasoning modes.
- **Module Selection:** Enable/disable individual cognitive modules (e.g., run without emotional analysis, or add entropy harmonization).
- **Safety Threshold Tuning:** Adjust risk tolerance for safety guardian interventions.
- **Ethical Stance Configuration:** Choose ethical frameworks (consequentialist, deontological, virtue-based, custom).
- **Memory Inspection:** View and manage conversation memory graphs, including retention policies and trace history.
- **Audit Mode:** Log every interaction with cryptographic timestamps for regulatory compliance.

**What Problems Does Local Use Solve?**

- **Data Sovereignty:** Your queries, data, and reasoning never leave your infrastructure. Critical for classified, proprietary, or sensitive work.
- **Audit Compliance:** Generate provable reasoning chains for financial, healthcare, legal, and government applications.
- **Zero Vendor Lock-In:** No subscription fees, no rate limits, no API deprecation. You own the stack.
- **Reproducibility:** Run identical reasoning pipelines across environments with checksummed deployments.
- **Trust & Transparency:** Inspect every line of logic. No hidden prompts, no opaque fine-tuning, no black-box biases.

## Quick Start

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./run.sh
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Run locally (Windows PowerShell):**

From the repository root you can run the backend and serve the frontend with the included helper:
```powershell
.\run_local.ps1
```

The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and the frontend assets (static files) are mounted at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui/

---

## Packaging and Attestation

```bash
./scripts/package_zip.sh
./scripts/checksums.sh axiom-v1.0.zip
python scripts/compute_attestation.py
```

**Security note**: scripts do not perform external network actions by default. Signing requires an explicit GPG_SIGNER environment variable.

---

## Local Validation (Windows)

Open PowerShell in the repo root and run:
```powershell
.\scripts\compute-integrity.ps1
```

This will compute a SHA256 over the three core markdown files and write VALIDATION/integrity_attestation.txt.
