# AxiomHive: Operator-Grade Proof-Driven Cognitive Infrastructure

**THIS IS NOT A TOY, DEMO, OR SURVEILLANCE AI.**

AxiomHive is production-ready, deterministic, operator-controlled infrastructure for engineers and organizations that demand zero black-boxes, full auditability, and cryptographic proof of integrity. No personality wrapper. No cloud dependency. No hidden telemetry. This is professional cognitive computing architecture designed for sovereignty, reproducibility, and high-stakes deployment.

## Professional Proof-Points

- **Cryptographic Attestation**: GPG signing, SHA256 checksums, and integrity validation scripts provide tamper-proof deployment verification.
- **Zero Black-Boxes**: Every reasoning step, safety check, and ethical evaluation is auditable. Open logic = provable outcomes.
- **Airgap Deployability**: Run entirely offline with no external APIs, no telemetry, no vendor lock-in.
- **Regulatory Readiness**: Generate provable logic trails for compliance audits, ethical reviews, and security assessments.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Versioned deployments with checksums ensure identical behavior across environments.
- **Schema Validation**: Strategy, principles, and deployment artifacts are validated against strict schemas for consistency.
- **Local Validation Suite**: Included scripts compute integrity attestations on-demand for third-party verification.

## Strategic Statement for Recruiters & Contractors

Adopting AxiomHive signals:

✓ **Deterministic Engineering Standards**: You work with provable, reproducible systems—not probabilistic guesswork.  
✓ **Audit-Ready Infrastructure**: Your workflows can withstand regulatory scrutiny and security assessments.  
✓ **Operational Sovereignty**: You control your compute, data, and logic—no dependency on opaque cloud services.  
✓ **Professional Rigor**: You understand that serious applications require verifiable infrastructure, not conversational toys.

If you're building for high-stakes environments—classified systems, compliance-heavy industries, research integrity, or zero-trust deployments—AxiomHive demonstrates you're equipped for collaboration at the professional tier.

## Why AxiomHive?

In an era of opaque, cloud-dependent AI services, AxiomHive provides:

- **Sovereignty & Zero Dependence**: Run entirely offline with airgap-deployable architecture. No external APIs, no telemetry, no vendor lock-in.
- **Transparent Cognitive Logic**: Every reasoning step, safety check, and ethical evaluation is auditable. Open logic means provable outcomes.
- **Operator-Driven Control**: You are not a passive user—you're an operator with direct agency over workflows, validation rules, and system behavior.
- **Security & Integrity by Design**: GPG signing, cryptographic attestation, schema validation, and reproducible builds ensure tamper-proof deployments.
- **Local-First Architecture**: Your data, your compute, your rules. Full-stack deployment runs on your hardware without external dependencies.

---

## Strategic Use Cases

- **Classified & Air-Gapped Deployments**: Operate cognitive pipelines in zero-trust environments with cryptographic integrity attestation.
- **Regulatory Compliance & Audit Trails**: Generate provable reasoning chains for financial services, healthcare, legal, and government applications.
- **Sovereign Research Infrastructure**: Deploy fully local cognitive systems for sensitive research without data exfiltration risk.
- **Mission-Critical Decision Support**: Run deterministic cognitive analysis for high-stakes operations where probabilistic black-boxes are unacceptable.
- **Ethical AI Development with Proof**: Transparent safety and ethics modules provide auditable guardrails you control—not vendor-imposed restrictions.

## Who Benefits?

**Engineers**: Deploy mission-critical cognitive pipelines with complete auditability, version control, and reproducible outcomes.  
**Researchers**: Run transparent experiments with verifiable reasoning engines and validation frameworks.  
**Security Teams**: Operate AI systems in air-gapped environments with cryptographic proof of integrity.  
**Compliance Officers**: Generate provable logic trails for regulatory audits and ethical reviews.  
**CTOs & Technical Leaders**: Demonstrate operational sovereignty and readiness for high-stakes collaboration.

## Operator Empowerment

AxiomHive treats you as an operator, not a user. This means:

✓ **Direct Agency**: Configure, validate, and modify system behavior at every level.  
✓ **Validation Power**: Schema validation, integrity checks, and attestation scripts give you proof, not promises.  
✓ **No Hidden Logic**: Every cognitive module is inspectable, debuggable, and under your control.  
✓ **Reproducible Outcomes**: Versioned deployments with checksums ensure identical behavior across environments.

This is professional infrastructure for serious applications—not a conversational toy.

## Quick Start

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./run.sh
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Run locally (Windows PowerShell):**

From the repository root you can run the backend and serve the frontend with the included helper:
```powershell
.\run_local.ps1
```

The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and the frontend assets (static files) are mounted at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui/

---

## Packaging and Attestation

```bash
./scripts/package_zip.sh
./scripts/checksums.sh axiom-v1.0.zip
python scripts/compute_attestation.py
```

**Security note**: scripts do not perform external network actions by default. Signing requires an explicit GPG_SIGNER environment variable.

---

## Local Validation (Windows)

Open PowerShell in the repo root and run:
```powershell
.\scripts\compute-integrity.ps1
```

This will compute a SHA256 over the three core markdown files and write VALIDATION/integrity_attestation.txt.
