An experimental natural language processing framework implementing basic text analysis tools with transparent, modular architecture.

## Overview

AxiomHive-LexLab is an educational NLP project that provides straightforward implementations of fundamental text processing operations. The codebase prioritizes code clarity and modularity to support learning and experimentation.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Text Tokenization**: Basic word and sentence boundary detection
- **Statistical Analysis**: Frequency counting and basic text statistics
- **Pattern Matching**: Regular expression-based text search utilities
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns across processing components

### Technical Characteristics

- Pure Python implementation with standard library dependencies
- Minimal external requirements (see `requirements.txt`)
- Unit test coverage for core modules
- MIT licensed for educational and commercial use

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE/AxiomHive-LexLab.git
cd AxiomHive-LexLab

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from lexlab import TextProcessor

# Initialize processor
processor = TextProcessor()

# Tokenize text
text = "Natural language processing enables text analysis."
tokens = processor.tokenize(text)

# Analyze frequency
freq_dist = processor.frequency_analysis(tokens)
print(freq_dist)
```

See `examples/` directory for additional usage patterns.
