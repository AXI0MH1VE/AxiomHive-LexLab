# GitHub Publishing Guide for IntegrityForge

**Complete step-by-step instructions for publishing IntegrityForge on GitHub**

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed locally
- IntegrityForge project files ready

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. Repository Details:
   - **Repository name**: `integrityforge`
   - **Description**: `Deterministic File Integrity Validation and Cryptographic Attestation System`
   - **Visibility**: Public (for showcase) or Private (for commercial)
   - **Initialize with README**: ❌ Uncheck (we have our own)
   - **Add .gitignore**: ❌ Uncheck (we have our own)
   - **Choose license**: MIT License

4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Upload Project Files

### Option A: Direct Upload (Recommended)

1. On the repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop the `IntegrityForge_v1.0.0.zip` file
3. Click "Commit changes"

### Option B: Git Clone and Push

```bash
# If you have git access to the repository
cd IntegrityForge
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/integrityforge.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 3: Repository Configuration

### Add Topics
Go to Repository Settings → General → Topics:
```
integrity, cryptography, sha256, validation, security, cli, python, deterministic, attestation
```

### Add Description
```
Deterministic File Integrity Validation and Cryptographic Attestation System

A professional-grade CLI utility for cryptographic file validation with enterprise security features, external configuration management, and CI/CD integration.

Features:
• SHA-256 streaming with constant-time comparison
• External YAML/INI/env configuration
• Clean exit codes (0/1/2/3) for automation
• Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
• One-command validation for CI/CD pipelines
```

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Features

### GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file is already included
- Automatically runs on push/PR with testing, validation, and security scanning

### Dependabot
Repository Settings → Security → Enable Dependabot security updates

### CodeQL Security Scanning
Repository Settings → Security → Enable CodeQL analysis

## Step 5: Documentation Setup

### Repository Structure
Ensure these files are properly uploaded:
```
IntegrityForge/
├── README.md              ✅ User guide and installation
├── STRATEGY.md            ✅ Executive strategy
├── PRINCIPLES.md          ✅ Engineering principles
├── DEPLOYMENT.md          ✅ Operations guide
├── requirements.txt       ✅ Dependencies
├── setup.py              ✅ PyPI packaging
├── src/integrityforge/   ✅ Core modules
├── tests/                ✅ Test suite
├── config/               ✅ Configuration files
├── scripts/              ✅ Automation scripts
└── .github/              ✅ CI/CD workflows
```

## Step 6: Repository Badges

Add these badges to your README.md:

```markdown
[![CI/CD](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/integrityforge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/integrityforge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/YOUR_USERNAME/integrityforge/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/YOUR_USERNAME/integrityforge)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/integrityforge)](https://pypi.org/project/integrityforge/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/YOUR_USERNAME/integrityforge)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/integrityforge/blob/main/LICENSE)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/integrityforge)](https://pypi.org/project/integrityforge/)
```

## Step 7: Release Creation

1. Go to Releases → "Create a new release"
2. Tag: `v1.0.0`
3. Title: `IntegrityForge v1.0.0 - Production Release`
4. Description:
   ```
   Complete deterministic file integrity validation system.

   Features:
   • SHA-256 cryptographic hashing with streaming support
   • Constant-time comparison for timing attack prevention
   • External configuration (YAML/INI/env variables)
   • Clean exit codes for CI/CD integration
   • Cross-platform compatibility
   • Professional documentation and testing

   Installation:
   pip install integrityforge

   Usage:
   integrityforge hash file.txt
   integrityforge validate --expected <hash> file.txt
   ```
5. Upload `IntegrityForge_v1.0.0.zip` as binary
6. Click "Publish release"

## Step 8: PyPI Publishing (Optional)

If you want to publish to PyPI:

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Build package
python -m build

# Upload to test PyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ integrityforge

# Upload to production PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

## Step 9: Repository Promotion

### Social Media & Communities
- Post on LinkedIn/Twitter with repository link
- Share on Reddit (r/programming, r/Python, r/cryptography)
- Join GitHub discussions and share your project

### Professional Networking
- Add to your portfolio/resume
- Share with potential employers/contractors
- Use as demonstration of engineering capabilities
