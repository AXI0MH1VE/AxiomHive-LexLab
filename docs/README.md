# Docs: Quick start and safety

Use the backend to serve `legend_manifest.json` and to run local kernel executions.

Windows notes:
- Use PowerShell scripts provided (e.g., `backend/run.ps1`) if not using WSL.
- Bash scripts expect a Unix-like shell (WSL or Git Bash).

CI will compute attestation and store a computed.sha256 artifact on push.
